            <h3>With its solar arrays deployed, NASA's Psyche spacecraft is big enough to almost cover a tennis
                court.</h3>
            <p>Psyche’s main computer, flight software, fault-protection systems, and most of the telecommunications
                systems come from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California. Attached to Psyche is
                the Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC), a NASA experiment that will test optical, or laser,
                communications beyond the Moon.</p>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <div id="paraOne">
            <p>Psyche is a NASA mission to study a metal-rich asteroid with the same name, located in the main asteroid
                belt between Mars and Jupiter. This is NASA’s first mission to study an asteroid that has more metal
                than rock or ice. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="paraTwo">
            <p>NASA and SpaceX are targeting Friday, Oct. 13, 2023, at 10:19 a.m. EDT for launch from Kennedy Space
                Center. Psyche will lift off from Launch Pad 39A aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. (Psyche is the
                first in a series of NASA science missions to be the primary payloads launched on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy
                rocket.)</p>
        </div>
        <div id="paraThree">
            <p>If all goes as planned, asteroid Psyche’s gravity will capture the spacecraft in late July 2029, and
                Psyche will begin its prime mission in August. It will spend about two years orbiting the asteroid to
                take pictures, map the surface, and collect data to determine Psyche’s composition. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="paraFour">
            <p>The body of the Psyche spacecraft is about the size of a small van, and it’s powered by solar electric
                propulsion. It has a magnetometer, a gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer, and a multispectral imager to
                study asteroid Psyche. The spacecraft will start sending images to Earth as soon as it spots the
                asteroid. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="paraFive">
            <p>Scientists think asteroid Psyche, which is about 173 miles (280 kilometers) at its widest point, could be
                part or all of the iron-rich core of a planetesimal, a building block of a rocky planet.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="paraSix">
            <p>The asteroid also could also be something else. It could be the leftover piece of a completely different
                kind of iron-rich body that formed from metal-rich material somewhere in the solar system. Psyche may be
                able to show us how Earth’s core and the cores of the other terrestrial planets came to be.</p>

        <h1>The Journey to Asteroid Psyche</h1>
        <div id="jParaOne">The Psyche spacecraft’s voyage to its namesake asteroid could (almost) be considered a
            journey to the center of the Earth. Asteroid Psyche might be an exposed core of a planetesimal, an early
            planetary building block. It might have been stripped of its outer layers by violent collisions during our
            solar system’s early formation.
        </div>
        <div id="jParaTwo">If it is a planetesimal, asteroid Psyche may offer a close look at the interior of
            terrestrial planets like Earth. We can’t bore a path to Earth’s metal core – or the cores of the other rocky
            planets – so visiting Psyche could provide a one-of-a-kind window into the violent history of collisions and
            accumulation of matter that created planets like our own.
